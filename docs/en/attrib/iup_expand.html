<h2>EXPAND<span class="style1"> (non inheritable*)</span></h2>
<p>Allows the element to expand, fulfilling empty spaces inside its container.</p>
<p>It is a non inheritable attribute, but a container inherit its parents EXPAND attribute. 
In other words, although EXPAND is non inheritable, it is inheritable for 
containers. So if you set it at a container it will not affect its children, 
except for those who are containers.</p>
<p>The expansion is done equally for all expandable elements in the same container.</p>
<p>For a container, the actual EXPAND value will be always a <strong>combination</strong> of its 
own value and the value of its <strong>children</strong>. In the sense that a container can only 
expand if its children can expand too in the same direction.</p>
<p>The HORIZONTALFREE and VERTICALFREE values will not behave as normal 
expansion. These values will NOT affect the expansion of the container when set 
at its children, the children will simply expand to the available free space at 
the container. (Since 3.11)</p>
<p>See the <a href="../layout_guide.html">Layout Guide</a> for more details 
  on sizes.</p>
