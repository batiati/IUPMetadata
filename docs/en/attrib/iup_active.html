<h2>ACTIVE</h2>
<p>Activates or inhibits user interaction.</p>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>&quot;YES&quot; (active), 
  &quot;NO&quot; (inactive).</p>
<p>Default: &quot;YES&quot;</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>An interface element is only active if its native parent is also active.</p>
<p>ACTIVE can also be set for controls that do not have user interaction because 
they may have a visual feedback to indicate the inactive state.</p>
<p>In GTK and Motif the inactive dialogs will still be able to move, resize and change their Z-order. Although their 
  contents will be inactive, keyboard will be disabled, and they can not be closed from the close box.</p>
<h3>Affects</h3>
<p>All controls that have visual representation.</p>
