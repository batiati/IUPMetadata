<h2>VALUE<span class="style1"> (non inheritable)</span></h2>

<p>Affects
    several elements differently - that is, its behavior is element dependent.
    It is often used to change the control's main value, such as the text of a
    <a href="../elem/iuptext.html">IupText</a>.
    </p>
<p>For
    the <a href="../elem/iupradio.html">IupRadio</a>
    and <a href="../elem/iupzbox.html">IupZbox</a>,
    elements,
    which are categorized as composition elements, this attribute represents the
    element "selected" among the others in the designed
    composition. To
    change this attribute in such cases, different mechanisms are necessary
    according to the programming environment used. When the elements taking part
    in a composition were created in C, this attribute's contents is a name
    that must be defined by the 
<a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">IupSetHandle</a>
    function.
    When the elements were created in Lua, this attribute's contents is the
    name of a variable - more precisely, the one receiving the return from the
    function that created the element you wish to select. In LED it is not
    possible to dynamically change the value of any attribute, so the elements
    created in this environment must be identified and manipulated in C by means
    of their identifying name.
