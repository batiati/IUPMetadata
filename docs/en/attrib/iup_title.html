<h2>TITLE<span class="style1"> (non inheritable)</span></h2>

<p>Element&#8217;s
    title. It is often used to modify some static text of the element (which
    cannot be changed by the user).</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Text.</p>
<p>Default: &quot;&quot;</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

  <p>The '\n' character usually is accepted for line change (except for menus). </p>
<p>The &quot;&amp;&quot; character can be used to define a MNEMONIC, use &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; 
	to show the &quot;&amp;&quot; character instead on defining a mnemonic.</p>
<p>If a mnemonic is defined then the 
  character relative to it is underlined and a key is associated so that when pressed together with the 
	Alt key activates the 
  control.</p>
<p>In GTk, if you define a mnemonic using &quot;&amp;&quot; and the string has an underscore, 
then make sure that the mnemonic comes before the underscore.</p>
<p>In GTK, if the MARKUP attribute is defined then the title string can contains 
pango markup commands. Works only if a mnemonic is NOT defined in the title. Not 
valid for menus.</p>

<h3>Affects</h3>

<p>All
    elements with an associated text.</p>
