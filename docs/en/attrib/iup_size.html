<h2>SIZE<span class="style2"> (non inheritable)</span></h2>
<p>Specifies the element <b>User</b> size, and 
  returns the <b>Current</b> size, in units proportional to the size of a character.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../layout_guide.html">Layout Guide</a> for more details 
  on sizes.</p>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>&quot;<i>width</i>x<i>height</i>&quot;, where width 
  and height
  are integer values corresponding to the 
  horizontal and vertical size, respectively, in characters fraction unit (see Notes 
below). 
</p>
<p>You can also set only one of the 
  parameters by removing the other one and maintaining the separator &quot;x&quot;, 
but this is equivalent of setting the other value to 0. For example: &quot;x40&quot; (height only 
= &quot;0x40&quot;) or &quot;40x&quot; (width only = &quot;40x0&quot;).</p>
<p>When this attribute is consulted the <b>Current</b> size of the control is returned. 
If both values are 0 then NULL is returned.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The size units observes the following 
  heuristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Width in 1/4's of the average width of a 
    character for the current <strong>FONT</strong> of each control.</li>
  <li>Height in 1/8's of the average height of a 
    character 
    for the current <strong>FONT</strong> of each control.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, a SIZE=&quot;4x8&quot; means 1 character width and 1 character height.</p>
<p>Notice that this is the <span class="style3">average</span> character size, 
the space occupied by a specific string is always different than its number of 
character times its average character size, except when using a monospaced font 
like Courier. Usually for common strings this size is smaller than the actual 
size, so it is a good practice to leave more room than expected if you use the 
SIZE attribute. For smaller font sizes this difference is more noticeable than 
for larger font sizes.</p>
<p>When this attribute is changed, the 
  <a href="iup_rastersize.html">RASTERSIZE</a>
  attribute is automatically updated.</p>
<p>SIZE depends on <a href="iup_font.html">FONT</a>, so when <strong>FONT</strong> is changed and
<strong>SIZE</strong> 
is set, then <strong>RASTERSIZE</strong> is also updated.</p>
<p>The average character size of the current <strong>FONT</strong> can be 
obtained from the <a href="iup_font.html#CHARSIZE">CHARSIZE</a> attribute.</p>
<p>To obtain the last computed <strong>Natural</strong> size of the element in pixels, use the read-only 
attribute <a href="iup_naturalsize.html">NATURALSIZE</a>. (Since 3.6)</p>
<p>To obtain the <strong>User</strong> size of the element in pixels after it is 
mapped, use the attribute <strong>USERSIZE</strong>. (Since 3.12)</p>
<hr class="style1">
<p>A <b>User</b> size of &quot;0x0&quot; can be set, it can also be set using NULL. 
If both values are 0 then NULL is returned.</p>
<p>If you wish to use the <b>User</b> size only as an initial size, change this attribute to NULL after the control is mapped, the returned size in 
<strong>IupGetAttribute</strong> will still be the 
  <b>Current</b> size.</p>
<p>The element is NOT immediately repositioned. Call
  <b>IupRefresh</b> to update the dialog layout. </p>
<p><b>IupMap</b> also updates the dialog layout even if it is already mapped, so 
  calling it or calling <b>IupShow</b>, 
  <b>IupShowXY</b> or 
  <b>IupPopup</b> (they all call 
  <b>IupMap</b>) will also update the dialog layout.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../layout_guide.html">Layout Guide</a> for mode details 
  on sizes.</p>
