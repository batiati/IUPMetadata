<h2>IupLayoutDialog <span class="style1">(since 3.3)</span></h2>
<p>Creates a Layout Dialog. It is a predefined dialog to visually edit the 
layout of another dialog in run time. It is a standard <strong>IupDialog</strong> 
constructed with other IUP elements. The dialog can be shown with any of 
the show functions <strong>IupShow</strong>, <strong>IupShowXY</strong> or
<strong>IupPopup</strong>.</p>
<p>Any existent dialog can be selected. It does not need to be mapped on the 
native system nor visible. It could have been created in C, LED or Lua.</p>
<p>The layout dialog is composed by two areas: one showing the given dialog 
children hierarchy tree, and one displaying its layout.</p>
<p>This is a dialog intended for developers, so they can see and inspect their 
dialogs in other ways.</p>

<h3><a name="Notes">Notes</a></h3>
<p>Since IUP 3.15 we added a global hot key to display the layout dialog loading 
the current dialog, just press Alt+Ctrl+Shft+L. Since IUP 3.17 these keys are 
only enabled if the global attribute GLOBALLAYOUTDLGKEY is enabled:</p>
<pre> IupSetGlobal("GLOBALLAYOUTDLGKEY", "Yes");</pre>
<h4>Menu</h4>
<pre><strong>Dialog</strong>
	<strong>New</strong>  - creates a new empty dialog, it will be destroyed when the layout is destroyed.
	<strong>Load</strong> - loads an existent dialog from the application.
	<strong>Load Visible</strong> - lists only visible dialogs from the application to be loaded.
	<strong>Reload</strong> - reloads the current dialog into the Layout Dialog.
	<strong>Export</strong> - exports the current dialog to a text file in the specified language.
		<strong>C</strong>
		<strong>LED</strong>
		<strong>Lua</strong>
	<strong>Redraw</strong> - send a redraw to the current dialog (IupRedraw).
	<strong>Show</strong> - shows the current dialog (IupShow) 
	<strong>Hide</strong> - hides the current dialog (IupHide) 
	<strong>Globals</strong> - shows a dialog to inspect and edit global attributes, functions and names
	<strong>Close</strong> - hides the Layout Dialog, optionally self destroy according to <strong>DESTROYWHENCLOSED</strong>.
<strong>Layout</strong>
	<strong>Show</strong> <strong>Tree</strong> - shows or hides the layout hierarchy tree at left.
	<strong>Refresh</strong> - recalculates the dialog (call IupRefresh).
	<strong>Update (Tree and Draw)</strong> - Rebuild the tree and redraw the layout.
	<strong>Auto Update Draw</strong> - periodically redraw the layout.
	<strong>Show Hidden</strong> - show hidden elements in the layout.
	<strong>Show Internal</strong> - show internal elements in the layout.
	<strong>Opacity</strong> - controls the Layout Dialog opacity so you can composite it on top of the selected dialog.
	<strong>Find Element</strong> - shows a dialog to search for elements in the layout. (since 3.22)</pre>
<p>Use <strong>Reload</strong> when the dialog has been changed and the layout 
was modified by the application. Use <strong>Update</strong> when attributes of 
the dialog were changed by the application and the layout needs to be redrawn.</p>
<p>The <strong>Export</strong> items will export only the dialog and its 
children. Associated elements such as menus and images will not be exported. The 
selected file will be overwritten if existent.</p>
<p>The <strong>Find</strong> dialog can search for several kinds of strings, 
such as: Type (element type like "button", "label", etc), Handle (handle name 
previously associated with IupSetHandle or declared in LED files), Name (the 
NAME attribute), Title (the TITLE attribute), Attribute (a combination of 
attribute and value using the format "attribute=value". All searches are not 
case sensitive. F3 can be used to search for the next occurrence, but focus must 
be on the IupLayoutDialog not at the Find dialog (notice that Handle and Name are 
searched only once). (since 3.22)</p>
<h4>Hierarchy Tree</h4>
<p>Each element inside the dialog is mapped to a node in the tree, and elements 
that are containers are branches in the tree. The node title shows the element 
class name, its TITLE attribute when available and its name when available. The 
selected node is synced with the selected element in the layout display in both 
ways. Using the right click over a node shows a context menu.</p>
<p>You can drag and drop items in the tree. But there are some restrictions 
according to each container possibilities. Some containers have internal 
children that are displayed but can not be changed.</p>
<h4>Layout Display</h4>
<p>The layout of an element is drawn with its Current size using its FONT, 
TITLE, BGCOLOR and FGCOLOR if any. But inheritance is not used intentionally to 
emphasize the element attributes. Only the first line (limited to 50 characters 
in the tree) is used from the element TITLE. Images are also used, but position 
of text and images are not the same as in the native control. This decoration is 
there simply to help locating the elements in the layout.</p>
<p>Containers that are not native elements are shown with dashed lines, other 
elements are shown with solid lines. When a red line is displayed along with a 
border of an element it means that element is maximizing its parent size, i.e. 
its <strong>Current</strong> size is equal to its <strong>Natural</strong> size 
and both are equal to the parent <strong>Client</strong> size. Usually this is 
the element determining the natural size of the container at least in the 
direction marked with red.</p>
<p>You can NOT drag and drop elements in the layout. Using the right click over 
an element shows a context menu, the same as in a tree node. When an element in 
the layout is double clicked and the actual element is visible, then the actual 
element will blink twice.</p>
<h4>Context Menu</h4>
<pre><strong>Properties</strong> - shows the properties dialog for the selected element.
<strong>Handle Name</strong> - allow to change the name set for the element with IupSetHandle.
<strong>Map</strong> - maps the selected element to the native system.
<strong>Unmap</strong> - unmaps the selected element from the native system. Its attribute are saved before unmapping.
<strong>Refresh Children</strong> - refresh the layout of the children of the element.
-----------------
<strong>Go To Parent</strong> - navigate to the parent of the element
<strong>Blink</strong> - makes the element blink on the interface, valid only for native elements.
<strong>Set Focus</strong> - changes the keyboard focus to the element.
-----------------
<strong>Copy</strong> - Prepare the selected element to be copied. Its attributes are also copied. The copy occurs only when pasted.
<strong>Cut</strong> - Prepare the selected element to be cut (re-parent). The cut occurs only when pasted.
<strong>Paste Insert Child</strong> - paste the copy or cut element as the <strong>first</strong> child of the selected container. 
<strong>Paste Insert at Cursor</strong> - paste the copy or cut element at the cursor mark of the selected container. (since 3.28)
<strong>Paste Append Child</strong> - paste the copy or cut element as the <strong>last</strong> child of the selected container.
<strong>Paste Insert Brother</strong> - paste the copy or cut element as brother of the selected element.
-----------------
<strong>New Insert Child</strong> - selects a class of control and creates a new element of that class, then insert it as the <strong>first</strong> child of the selected container. The new element is not mapped.
<strong>New Insert at Cursor</strong> - selects a class of control and creates a new element of that class, then insert it at the cursor mark of the selected container. The new element is not mapped. (since 3.28)
<strong>New Append Child</strong> - selects a class of control and creates a new element of that class, then insert it as the <strong>last</strong> child of the selected container. The new element is not mapped.
<strong>New Insert Brother</strong> - selects a class of control and creates a new element of that class, then insert it as brother of the selected element. The new element is not mapped.
<strong>-----------------
Remove</strong> - removes the selected element. </pre>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>The <strong>Properties</strong> dialog allows the inspection and change of the elements 
attributes. It contains 3 Tab sections: one for the registered attributes of the 
element, one for custom attributes set at the hash table, and one for the 
callbacks. The callbacks are just for inspection, and custom attribute should be 
handled carefully because they may be not strings. Registered attributes values 
are shown in red when they were changed by the application. It uses the <a href="iupelementpropdialog.html">IupElementPropertiesDialog</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Globals</strong> dialog is very similar to the <strong>Properties</strong> 
dialog but used for global attributes (<a href="../func/iupsetglobal.html">IupSetGlobal</a>/<a href="../func/iupgetglobal.html">IupGetGlobal</a>), 
functions (set by <a href="../func/iupsetfunction.html">IupSetFunction</a>) and 
names (set by <a href="../func/iupsethandle.html">IupSetHandle</a>).</p>
<h4>Insert Cursor (since 3.28)</h4>
<p>The cursor mark in green is shown only inside a selected container that can 
receive more children. In the <strong>IupCbox</strong> container the cursor is a 
point, on the other containers the cursor is a vertical or horizontal line 
accordingly. Elements can be pasted, created a new one, or dropped in a cursor 
mark.</p>
<h4>Drag &amp; Drop of Elements (since 3.28)</h4>
<p>It was possible only to drag &amp; drop controls in the tree. </p>
<p>But now it is possible to drag &amp; drop in the layout too. When the element is 
dragged the selection is not changed, when there is a cursor mark in a container 
is where the drop will occur. So before dragging an element first select the 
container you want to drop it, so the cursor mark can be displayed while 
dragging. Also like in the tree it is possible to drag a container with all its children. But there will be 
no visual feedback of the drag, with the exception of a mouse cursor changed to 
a "move" symbol. </p>
<p>Inside a <strong>IupCbox</strong> container the drag &amp;drop is different. 
First when dragging immediate children of the IupCbox the change occurs 
simultaneously and can be visually seen in the layout and in the IupCbox itself 
if the dialog is visible. When the IupCbox is not selected the move occurs only 
from one point to another inside the container, i.e. the hierarchy is not 
changed, just its position inside the container. When the IupCbox is selected any element from the IupCbox hierarchy can 
be moved (re-parent) to be a direct child of the IupCbox. When another container 
is selected, and there is a cursor mark the drop will be placed in that 
container.</p>
<h4>Inspecting Native Controls</h4>
<p>The <strong>Spy++</strong> tool distributed with Microsoft Visual Studio is 
very useful to inspect windows controls position, size and visibility. It can be 
found in the Visual Studio "Tools" menu.</p>
<p>The <strong>GTK+ Inspector</strong> tool included in GTK is very useful to 
inspect GTK controls position, size and visibility. To enable the GTK+ 
inspector, you can use the Control-Shift-I or Control-Shift-D keyboard 
shortcuts, or set the GTK_DEBUG=interactive&nbsp;environment variable. </p>
