<h2>IDLE_ACTION</h2>
<p>Predefined IUP action, generated when there 
  are no events or messages to be processed. Often used to perform background operations.</p>
<h3>Callback</h3>
<pre>int function(void); [in C]</pre>
<p><u>Returns</u>: if IUP_CLOSE is returned the current loop will be closed and 
the callback will be removed. If IUP_IGNORE is returned the callback is removed 
and normal processing continues.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The Idle callback will be called whenever there are no messages left to be 
processed. But this occurs more frequent than expected, for example if you move 
the mouse over the application the idle callback will be called many times 
because the mouse move message is processed so fast that the Idle will be called 
before another mouse move message is schedule to processing.</p>
<p>So this callback changes the message loop to a more CPU consuming one. It is 
important that you set it to NULL when not using 
it. Or the application will be consuming CPU even if the callback is doing 
nothing.</p>
<p>It can only be set using <b>IupSetFunction(</b>name, func<b>)</b>.</p>
<h4>Lua Binding&nbsp;</h4>
<p>To modify this action use the 
  function <b>iup</b>.<b>SetIdle</b><b>(</b>func<b>)</b> 
  in Lua. 
  Using 
  nil 
  as a parameter to remove the association. </p>
<h4>Long Time Operations</h4>
<p>If you create a loop or an operation that takes a long time to complete inside a callback 
of your 
application then the user interface message loop processing is interrupted until 
the callback returns, so the user can not click on any control of the 
application. But there are ways to handle that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>call <strong>IupLoopStep</strong> or <strong>IupFlush</strong> inside 
	the application callback when it is performing long time operations. This 
	will allow the user to click on a cancel button for instance, because the 
	user interface message loop will be processed.</li>
	<li>split the operation in several parts that are processed by the <strong>
	Idle</strong> function when no messages are left to be processed for the 
	user interface message loop. This will make a heavy use of the CPU, even if 
	the callback is doing nothing.</li>
	<li>split the operation in several parts but use a <strong>Timer</strong> to 
	process each part.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you just want to do something simple as a background redraw of an <strong>
IupCanvas</strong>, then a better idea is to handle the &quot;idle&quot; state yourself. 
For example, register a timer for a small time like 500ms, and reset the timer 
in all the mouse and keyboard callbacks of the <strong>IupCanvas</strong>. If 
the timer is trigged then you are in idle state. If the <strong>IupCanvas</strong> 
loses its focus then stop the timer.</p>
