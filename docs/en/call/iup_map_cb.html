<h2>MAP_CB</h2>
<p>Called right after an element is mapped 
  and its attributes updated in <a href="../func/iupmap.html">IupMap</a>.</p>
<p>When the element is a dialog, it is called after the layout is updated. For 
all other elements is called before the layout is updated, so the element 
current size will still be 0x0 during MAP_CB (since 3.14).</p>
<h3>Callback</h3>

<strong>ih</strong>:map_cb() -&gt; (<strong>ret</strong>: number) [in Lua]</pre>
<p><strong>ih</strong>:
  identifier of the element that activated the event.</p>
<h3>Affects</h3>
<p>All that have a native representation.</p>
